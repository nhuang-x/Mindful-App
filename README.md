# HackDuke 2021: Health Track

This project was created with health and wellbeing in mind. We were inspired to build this web app when thinking of what aspects of our health we would like to improve. As college students, it is hard to maintain wellbeing while focusing on schoolwork. Thus, we created the Mindful Garden to encourage meditation, mood journaling, mindful breathing, and regular sleep schedule to promote and maintain mental health and wellbeing.

Our web app has several different tabs corresponding to meditation, mood journaling, mindful breathing, and sleep schedule. In the meditation tab, there are various meditation and yoga videos for users to watch. In the journaling tab, users receive a question prompt based upon the current emotion they are feeling. In the breathing tab, users can follow a diagram that instructs them to mindfully breathe. In the sleep tab, users can enter in what time they slept and woke up, see if they got enough sleep, and the impacts of how much sleep they got.
